# Project Title

5-in-a-row bot 

## Summary

Five-in-a-row (or gomoku) is a common game worldwide. Multiple AI bots have been built and beat human players in chess and go, however gomoku remains an untouched territory thanks to its simplicity (or lack of interests, who knows).     

## Background

Gomoku is a simple and fun game to play for children in Asian countries. The game used to be played on paper but now many websites offer online games - connect millions of players around the world. 

This project was created to be a fun coding experiment, hence why a simple and common game was chosen to be the target. Original gomoku was known to be a sure-win game, which the player who moves first gained significant advantages over the opponent. However, multiple version of gomoku has been developed and published to reduce these imbalances.

## How is it used?

This project will first try to build the board and rule of the gomoku (19x19 board). [If you want to try the gomoku online, I suggest this website playok.com]

Then, I will try to build a bot and play with it to improve its ability. To the best of my knowledge, there is no database about this game yet, so building with be a time-consuming task.

I've read some technique to let 2 bots play against each other and learn from themselve - will try this out!

I'll play with the bot until it can consistently beat me. After that, I'll try to use it for online game (for testing purpose, not cheating :P). A 1900-elo on playok would be considered success at this stage. 

The next stage would be implement different rule and retrain the bot with new rule. [to be determined]

## Data sources and AI methods
To be determined

## Challenges

Time can be a challenge as online game usually require less than 2 second per move. 

Ethical problem: 
If the bot is good enough, I may use it for online game and breaking the leaderboard on playok.com (just kidding)
If success and well-known, the bot may kill the people enthusiasm for this game (see what happened when AI bot beat best Go player: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol)

## What next?

Collecting data for now. Will update when more thing come up
